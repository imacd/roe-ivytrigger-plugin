        Give the setting for whether the resolved dependencies should be saved to disk.<br/>
        If true, the dependency tree resolved for this run of the trigger is saved to the job config directory on the master server.<br/>
        If the jenkins server is restarted, the saved dependencies are loaded into memory the first time the trigger polls.
